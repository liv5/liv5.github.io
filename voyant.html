  <center><h2>Analysis of a corpus of 22 Edgar Allan Poe stories using Voyant</h2></center>

  <p>Poe is one of my all time favorite authors, so I decided to work with a collection of his short stories as my corpus to work with for the visualization project.</p>

  <li>The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade</li>

  <li>Mesmeric Revelation </li>     
  <li>The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar</li>      
  <li>The Black Cat</li>      
  <li>The Fall of the House of Usher</li>      
  <li>Silence--a Fable  </li>    
<li>The Masque of the Red Death </li>

    <li>Eleonora</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>My purpose of using the word cloud and terms berry visualizations is to analyze the vocabulary and most frequently used words in Poe's stories. I want to know if there is a textual reason as to why some of Poe's stories are more famous than others. Since he is well know for being a master of horror and suspense, I wanted to know if his lesser known stories also fell into this genre based on analyzing vocabulary.</p>

<h2>Customized elements</h2>
<p>I customized my word clouds by adding words to the stop list, such as like, said, say, came, they, themselves, and just. These words weren't important to the kind of vocabulary that I wanted to compare among all the texts. These words were showing up frequently, so by removing them I could get more diverse frequent words to show up.</p>
<p>I also customized the word clouds by adjusting the number of words that I wanted to appear. For the cloud that represented all 22 stories, I chose 55 most frequent words to look in order to get a broad spectrum. When I was looking at a smaller corpus of his well known and lesser known stories, I changed the word cloud to show only 25 words, since the number of stories was much lower.</p>
<h2>Interpretation of data</h2>
<p>I first analyzed the most popular words in both word clouds. For the popular stories, they were length, night, thought, and death. For the less popular stories, they were great, king, length, little, and day. Words both clouds had in common were man, length, time, saw, long, and old. I began to see some traits in the popular story word cloud that other other one didn't have. The first trait I noticed in the popular cloud was that it has words that can be put into groups. There is a group of words directly related to the body and senses, such as eye, eyes, heart, head, sound, and heard. There is also a group of words related to the structure of a building, such as floor, walls, and door. Another interesting finding was that the words "night" and "death" only appear in the cloud for the popular stories. In fact, the less popular story cloud has the word "day" as one of it's most popular words.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>From what I gathered from the word frequencies and types of vocabulary Poe used, I believe that the reason the popular Poe stories continue to be so well know is because they align so well with his horror and suspense writing style. As the word cloud shows, the most frequent words are death, night, heart, long, sound, etc., which are themselves elements of his popular stories. Words such as death and night aren't even shown in the word cloud for this lesser known stories, and I would guess that because of this, these stories don't fall into the genre of horror and suspense as well as his popular stories do. </p>
