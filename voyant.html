<h1>Analysis of a corpus of 22 Edgar Allan Poe Stories using Voyant</h1>
<h2></h2>
  <p>Poe is one of my all time favorite authors, so I decided to work with a collection of his short stories as my corpus to work with for the visualization project. I selected all the text from one of my favorite stories of Poe's, "The Cask of Amontillado". As you can see in the word cloud, Amontillado, ugh, and Fortunato are a few of the most frequent words in the story.</p>
  <p>Word cloud of 55 words</p>
