  <h2><p>Biography</p></h2>
  <p>As a second year student in the M.A. Literature and Composition program at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, I have completed coursework that has offered me opportunities to critically examine various literary periods and genres.  Courses of particular interest included American Literature Before 1870 and The Silent Film Era, among others.  I was also able to develop critical knowledge of the complexities of language and linguistics in Second Language Literacies, and Language and Social Context courses. My professional aspirations include but are not limited to working in corporate communications, technical writing, teaching community college, and teaching at the university level.</p>
