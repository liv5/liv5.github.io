  <div class="a"><p>As a recent graduate from the M.A. Literature and Composition program at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, I am ready to apply my knowledge and skills about English, writing, digital humanities, rhetoric, literature, and art to where they may best be applied to their full potential. My professional aspirations include but are not limited to performing the duties required for content writing, technical writing, social media managing, and teaching at the community college level. My interests outside of academia include skiing, hiking, outdoor photography, and reading news, memoirs, and various topics and genres of non-fiction prose.
