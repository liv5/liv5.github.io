  <h2><p>Biography</p></h2>
  <p>    As a second year student in the M.A. Literature and Composition program at Indiana Universtiy of Pennsylvania, I have completed coursework where I had the opportunity to critically examine a specific literary time period and genre, such as American literature before 1870 and the silent film era, as well as look at complexities with language and linguistics in the courses second language literacies, and language and social context. I have successfully completed the course, teaching college literature, and will complete the teaching writing course this semester. My professional aspirations include but are not limited to working in business communications, teaching community college, and teaching at the university level.</p>
