  <h2><p>Biography</p></h2>
  <div class="a"><p>As a second year student in the M.A. Literature and Composition program at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, I have critically examined various literary periods, genres, and areas of composition studies.  Courses of particular interest included American Literature Before 1870, The Silent Film Era, Teaching College Literature, and Language and Social Context. My professional aspirations include but are not limited to working in corporate communications, technical writing, teaching community college, and teaching at the university level upon completion of a PhD. My interest outside of academia include skiing, hiking, photography, and reading.
